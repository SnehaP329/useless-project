# TIME WASTER 🎯


## Basic Details

### Team Name: TRASHY

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sneha.P - GEC Kozhikode
- Member 2: Abinaya.K.M - GEC Kozhikode


### Project Description
Ever wanted to feel productive while actually doing absolutely nothing useful?
This project exists purely to consume your precious time with pointless questions, sarcastic responses, and a gameplay experience that has no educational value whatsoever.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There is no right or wrong answer in this quiz game.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
There is no solution. Keep it fun!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVA SCRIPT


### Implementation
For Software:
1. HTML – Creates the structure of the game (background video, name input, question display, answer box, buttons).
2. CSS – Makes it look slightly less ugly while wasting your time.
3. JavaScript – Handles the game logic:
Loads a question from a predefined list.
Checks if your answer matches the “correct” one.
Gives sarcastic responses when you fail (which you probably will).
Tracks how long you’ve been wasting your life playing this game.
